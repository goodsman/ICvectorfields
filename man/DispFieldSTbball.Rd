\title{Diplacement fields using bounding box when velocity varies spatially}
\usage{
DispFieldSTbball(
  inputstack1,
  lagmax,
  rowmn,
  rowmx,
  colmn,
  colmx,
  restricted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputstack1}{a raster stack with each raster layer representing an
instance of time. The raster stack should be organized such that the first
raster in the stack is the first observed spatial dataset and time
progresses forward with the third dimension index of the raster stack. The
raster stack should contain only numeric values. Any NA value will be
converted to a zero}

\item{lagmax}{an integer representing the maximum time lag}

\item{rowmn}{an integer denoting the minimum row index of the sub-grid}

\item{rowmx}{an integer denoting the maximum row index of the sub-grid}

\item{colmn}{an integer denoting the minimum column index of the sub-grid}

\item{colmx}{an integer denoting the maximum column index of the sub-grid}

\item{restricted}{logical (TRUE or FALSE)}
}
\value{
A data frame is returned with the following column names: rowcent,
colcent, frowmin, frowmax, fcolmin, fcolmax, centx, centy, dispx, and
dispy. The rowcent and colcent column names are the row and column indices
for the center of each sub-grid; frowmin and frowmax are the sub-grid
minimum and maximum row indices; fcolmin and fcolmax are the sub-grid
minimum and maximum column indices; centx and centy are the projected
coordinates of the centre of the subgrid derived from the raster input
files; dispx and dispy are the orthoganal velocity vectors in units of
space per timestep in the horizontal and vertical directions in the same
spatial units as the projected coordinates of the raster input files.
}
\description{
This is an implementation of a novel algorithm that differs from more
traditional digital image correlation implementations that are applied in the
\code{\link{DispField}} and \code{\link{DispFieldbb}} functions. This version
is similar to the \code{\link{DispFieldSTbb}} function except that it does
not require a specific time lag. Instead the user specifies a maximum time
lag and the function computes displacement vectors using the time lag that
produces the maximum speed (magnitude of displacement divided by time lag).
The function calculates a displacement field representing persistent movement
based on the cross-covariance in a raster stack (in this case a sequential
series of rasters) presumably representing spatial population abundance or
density at more than two different instances of time. If analysis is
restricted to only two time instances, \code{\link{DispFieldbb}} is more
appropriate.
}
\details{
The DispFieldSTbball function has the same inner workings as the
\code{\link{DispFieldSTbb}} function except that instead of specifying a
specific time lag, the user specifies a maximum time lag. The function then
cycles through all lags up to the maximum time lag and choses the for each
location the maximum speed. The DispFieldSTbball function is more appropriate
than \code{\link{DispFieldSTbb}} when velocity is variable in space.

Caution is warranted when defining the bounding box dimensions because the
function can produce erroneous results when the bounding box is too small.
