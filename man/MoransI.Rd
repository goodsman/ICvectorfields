\title{Efficiently compute Moran's I statistic}
\usage{
MoransI(mat1, r1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat1}{a matrix of values; NA/Inf values must be coded as NA and are ignored}

\item{r1}{the distance (radius), within which nearby cells are considered neighbours
in units of rows/columns}
}
\value{
a single numeric value for Moran's I
}
\description{
Compute Moran's I for a matrix. A fast implementation of Moran's I for
gridded data, with neighbours defined based on a radial distance. Note
that when using radius to define the neighbourhood, a radius of one
corresponds to the rook's neibhourhood, whereas a radius of 1.5 corresponds to
the queen's neighbourhood.
