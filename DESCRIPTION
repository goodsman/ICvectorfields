Description: This package takes a time series of abundance or density data in raster 
    format and produces vector fields of population movement using the digital image 
    correlation technique. More specifically, the functions in the package compute 
    cross-covariance using discrete fast Fourier transforms for computational 
    efficiency. Vectors in vector fields point in the direction of highest two 
    dimensional cross-covariance. The package has a novel implementation of the 
    digital image correlation agorithm that is designed to detect persistent 
    directional movement when image time series extend beyond a sequence of 
    two raster images.
