#' Xcov2D
#'
#' This function efficiently computes 2D cross-covariance of two equal
#' dimensioned matrices of real numbers using efficient discrete fast Fourier
#' trasforms.
#'
#' The algorithm first pads each matrix with zeros so that the outer edges of
#' the matrices do not interact with one another due to the circular nature of
#' the discrete fast Fourier transform. Cross-covariance calculations require
#' computation of the complex conjugate of one of the two imput matrices.
#' Assuming all of it's elements are real, computing the complex conjugate is
#' equivalent to flipping the matrix in the horizontal and vertical directions.
#' Then to compute cross-covariance, the first matrix is convolved with the
#' flipped second matrix as described in the convolution theorem.
#'
#' The shift that produces the maximum cross-covariance between the two input
#' matrices can be obtained by finding the row and column indices associated
#' with the maximum cross-covariance. The shift in each direction is obtained by
#' subracting one plus the half the dimension of the output matrix (the same for
#' rows and columns) from the row and column values that are associated with the
#' maximum cross-covariance as demonstrated in the examples below. Note that
#' shifts to the right and up are denoted with positive numbers and shifts to
#' the left and down are denoted by negative numbers. This is contrary to some
#' conventions but efficient for producing producing vector fields. For more
#' details on cross-covariance see
#' \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation}{cross-correlation}.
