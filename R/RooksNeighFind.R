#' Classify Rook's Neighbours Comprising Spread Patterns in Vector Fields
#'
#' After running the \code{\link{PatternDetect}} function, this function enables
#' classification of neighbour cells. Because the pattern detect function
#' classifies central cells according to the patterns of vector direction in
#' their Rook's neighbourhood, the neighbouring grid locations that comprise the
#' pattern are not labeled. This is remedied by the RooksNeighFind function
#' which classifies neighbour cells around focal grids classified with one of
#' the four patterns that the \code{\link{PatternDetect}} function is able to
#' recognize. The function returns a data frame similar to the input data frame
#' with a column appended. In the appended column, neighbours surrounding focal
#' cells labeled with a particular pattern will be labeled as follows:
#' neighbours of the divergence pattern are labeled with a one, neighbours of
#' the convergence pattern are labeled with a two, neighbours of the partial
#' divergence pattern are labeled with a three, and neighbours of the partial
#' convergence pattern are labeled with a four. In cases where neighbours are
#' shared, the priority order from lowest to highest is four for partial
#' convergence to one for divergence. Thus, a neighbour that is shared between a
#' focal grid classified as a convergence and a nearby focal grid classified as
#' a divergence will be labeled with a one instead of a two.

#' @param vfdf A data frame as returned by \code{\link{PatternDetect}}
#'
#' @return A data frame similar to vfdf except that it includes an additional
#'   column called NeighType as described above.
