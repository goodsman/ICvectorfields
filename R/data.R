#' Simulated movement data
#'
#' Data based on a partial differential equation were simulated using the
#' ReacTran R package. The simulation algorith uses a finite differencing scheme
#' with backwards differencing. The model used for simulation is a reaction
#' diffusion-advection equation in which the advection term is variable in space
#' but diffusion and reactions are constant in space:
#'
#' \deqn{\frac{\partial(c)}{\partial{t}} = \nabla (D \nabla c) - \nabla (v c) + r}
#'
#' The parameters used in the partial differntial equation above are
#'
#' D = 0.01 per squared spatial unit
#'
#' r = 0.5 per unit time
#'
#' v (advection is variable in space): in the upper left quadrant of the
#' square domain v = (0.2, 0); in the upper right quadrant v = (0, -0.2);
#' in the lower right quadrant v = (-0.2, 0); in the lower right quadrant
#' v = (0, 0.2). Obviously v is discontinous at the quadrant boundaries,
#' which causes some interesting model behaviour that is limited by
#' considering only the first six time steps such that the bulk of the
#' concentration in each quadrant does not cross a quadrant boundary.
#'
#' The intial condition at time = 0 is a concentration of one unit per
#' arbitrary unit of volume in the central cell of each quadrant.
#'
#' External boundary conditions are zero-gradient (reflecting).
#'
#' The data are formatted such that they can easily be converted to a raster
#' stack using ICvectorfields::RastStackData(SimData).
