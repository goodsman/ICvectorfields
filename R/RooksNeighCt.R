#' Define a subset of grid locations with non-overlapping rook neighborhoods
#'
#' This function prunes the data frame returned by the
#' \code{\link{PatternDetect}} function such that it includes only rook's
#' neighborhoods that do not overlap. Pruning is done by sequential removal of
#' observations that are too near one another and as a result are overlapping.
#' Locations that are the most highly connected are removed first.
#'
#' The reason for this function's existence is to facilitate probabilistic
#' calculations regarding whether certain patterns are occurring more or less
#' often that would be expected by chance. If rook's neighborhoods in which
#' patterns are observed overlap, then the assumption of probabilistic
#' independence is necessarily incorrect. Thus, overlap invalidates any
#' calculation of the probability of occurrence of a particular pattern if that
#' calculation assumes independence. The pruning actions of this function enable
#' the user to more safely assume probabilistic independence.

#' @param vfdf A data frame as returned by \code{\link{PatternDetect}}
#'
#' @return A data frame similar to vfdf except that it includes only grid
#'   locations with speed estimates in all four adjacent grid locations in their
#'   rook's neighborhood. An additional column called IndPatternCt is appended
#'   which contains NA values for locations that are overlapping other locations
#'   and ones for all non-overlapping locations that have speed estimates in all
#'   four adjacent cells.
